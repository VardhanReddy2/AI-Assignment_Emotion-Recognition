# Facial Emotion Recognition using Genetic Algorithm

> Study on how the Genetic Algorithm can be used in facial emotion recognition and the results using different classifiers.

## Used:

- CK+ dataset and our team images with different emotions
- OpenFace for landmarks and Action Units(AU) extraction from the images
- Worked on a single emotion (disgust)
- pandas & numpy for data cleaning and data processing
- Classifiers used:
    - Decision Tree Classifier 
    - KNN Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
